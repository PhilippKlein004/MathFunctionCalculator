	INTRODUCTION
	
	This project, called 'MathTools,' is just for experimentation. The purpose is to calculate 	functions like 'f(x) = ...'. You'll also be given the option to draw the function and get its 	zero point. Adding to the zero points, you can derive a function and get its extreme point.

	I know that not everything is efficiently written, but I give my best :)


	HOW TO USE

	The only way to run the programs is by running the main method. The program is written in 	Java! If you have java installed on your drive, follow these steps :


		1. Change the directory in the console : 

			for macOS/Linux : 'cd /Users/yourusername/Desktop/MathTools'
			for Windows 	: 'cd C:\Users\yourusername\Desktop\MathTools'

		2. Start the program :

			for macOS/Linux	: 'java main.java'
				Windows : 'java main.java'

	Done!


	INSTALL JAVA

	Open your terminal, PowerShell or any other form of console. First, check if you have java 
	installed on your device. You can check by typing 'java' into the console and hit enter. If a 
	long list appears, you have java installed on your system. If not, you'll need to install 
	java.

	You can download it from here :
