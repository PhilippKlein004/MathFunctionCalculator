# MathFunctionCalculator
This program lets you calculate and draw a mathematical function. It calculates the value of the function for a given x value and can draw the function into a coordinate system (50x50). The calculator is array-based.  If you want to know everything about this program, I've made a PDF, that I've uploaded to my website (https://kleinworkspace.com).
